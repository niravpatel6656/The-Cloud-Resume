            As an experienced AWS Cloud Architect, I specialize in designing and
            implementing scalable and secure cloud-based solutions that meet
            businesses' unique needs. With expertise in cloud architecture,
            infrastructure automation, and DevOps practices, I can bring
            significant value to your organization. I have experience with AWS
            services such as EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, and Lambda, and I am skilled in
            using IAC tools such as AWS CloudFormation and Terraform. I excel in
            implementing CI/CD pipelines and DevOps tools such as Git, Jenkins,
            and Docker.
